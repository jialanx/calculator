# JavaScript Calculator
A fully functional calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This calculator supports PEMDAS order of operations, decimal numbers, and includes error handling for invalid inputs.

Features
-----------------
✅ Handles operations: +, -, ×, ÷, ^, ()

✅ Evaluates expressions using PEMDAS

✅ Accepts decimal numbers

✅ Provides error messages for invalid expressions

✅ Responsive UI

How It Works
-----------------
The calculator parses and evaluates string expressions in JavaScript. It uses recursive methods to handle parenthesis and an array to handle order of operations. I tried using multiple functions to reduce redundancy and increase modularity!
